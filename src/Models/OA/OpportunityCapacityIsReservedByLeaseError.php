/**
 * 
 * Error Use Case: The available capacity required to book a specific Opportunity is reserved by a lease held by another Customer.  If the `OrderItem` is repeated (for multiple attendees) this error MUST only be included in the API response against the `OrderItem`s which are in excess of the capacity but which are reserved by the lease of another Customer - for example in an Opportunity with a `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of 3, with 1 additional space held by another lease, then for an `OrderQuote` with 9 `OrderItem`s related to it, this error would only be emitted against 1 of the `OrderItem`s, with `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError` emitted against the other 5 of the `OrderItem`s. This helps a Customer to know whether they should try again.
 * 
 * This type is derived from https://schema.org/Thing, which means that any of this type's properties within schema.org may also be used.
